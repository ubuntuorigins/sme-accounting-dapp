# Risks Assessment

The main challenge that the team foresees would be level of education and internet connectivity to allow for optimum and easy use of the DApp. However, the data from International Labour Office (2018) reveals that the 90% informal sector is dominated by youths between ages 15-24, this presents great opportunity for the future as more efforts are been made to increase internet connectivity and education in Africa. Also, the project would commence in Ghana, a country with free high school education and improving the level of education of its youths. 

Also, internet connectivity is better in urban areas than rural areas therefore, focusing on urban informal sector would aid to overcoming connectivity issues in the short time while expanding to rural areas with time.
