# Solution in Details

It has been said by _**Charles Hoskinson**_ that, _‘Cardano is an open platform that seeks to provide economic identity to billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value and governance’_.

With Cardano’s strategic plan for Africa, there is a no greater way to help Africa without focusing on its traditional economy thus informal sector. This sector is important because it sustains billions of livelihoods in Africa. 

According to Africa Development Bank (2013), the informal sector is a major source of employment which accounts for 70% of employment in Sub-Sahara Africa and 60% in North Africa. The World Bank (2020) has reiterated that the urban informal sector accounts for 80.8% of employment in Africa.

The informal economy in Africa is bigger and impact most livelihoods in Africa. It is the very back bone of African’s economic activities. It includes the local corner shop, street vendor, and as high as manufacturing. They are full of creators and entrepreneurs and a unique space that is advancing decentralized solution off-grid. The off-grid feature existing in their operation makes difficult to identify and takes longer time to build trust and mutual cooperation. Cardano blockchain is a platform to integrate informal sector activities on the grid with focus on reducing the risk associated with informal sector and build DApp tool to provide identification and accounting and financial inclusion for informal sector. 

Our DApp would be built to develop a registry and accounting solutions for the informal sector businesses which would be the basis for financial inclusiveness.
