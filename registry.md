# Solution A - The Registry

The focus of centralized government has priority in increasing taxes and formalizing businesses within the informal sector. The former has deepened the burden and increased production cost whereas the latter has not been effective at all. 

The informal sector is tooted in traditional Africa origins hence, understanding the need for the sector to maintain its original form while undertaking initiatives to boost productivity levels among players in the sector is the way to go and blockchain technology would be effective in maintaining their original form whilst increasing productivity levels. Increasing productivity is the surest way to making the informal sector bridge the gap with formal sector and progressively formalize and improve livelihoods of their workforce. This would require strategic partnership to provide financial inclusiveness and identification system for players in the sector. 

The **Registry** would function using **ATALA Prism** to provide unique identity for individual businesses in the informal sector. The identification would function in three ways;

1. Identification of Informal Business Owners
2. Identify various classification of Informal business activities to various economic sector such as manufacturing, transportation, Retail & Whole Sales
3. Identification of workforce employed by particular informal business.

The three functions would interplay to provide unique identities for informal businesses which would facility access to finance assistance which is absent in the operations of the sector.  

The quality of identification would be leverage on to provide credibility and reliability for strategic partnership, reduce risk and increase productivity. For instance, number of workforces employed by a particular informal business is a good indicator to accessing the strength, growth and expansion of the business in Africa. 

It is trite that the private informal sector would not employ anyone unless you add value to their business operation (unlike public/government sector).
